A growing set of SVG icons that can be used with a single universal [web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/).

The `rounded-icon` component is a [web component](https://www.webcomponents.org/) built with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), so it is easy to use in any modern browser environment. And it only takes a few lines of additional code to integrate with Vue, React, Angular, or any other web framework.

## Web Component

See complete docs in the [Web Component section](/docs/web/component)

## Javascript Frameworks

Official packages for major Javascript frameworks are coming soon. However, developers can still use the assets by downloading the icon sets from NPM or GitHub and importing them into their projects.
