You will be prompted for credentials when configuring your first file using the `glyphs add` command.

The file key as well as the personal access token are supplied by Figma.

## File Key

This is the ID for the Figma file and can be extracted from the file URL:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/<FILE-KEY>/.../...
```

## Personal Access Token

You can create a new personal access token from the Settings page in Figma.

You can also [learn more](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens) about how it is used.
