### Categories

Icons are grouped into categories. The categories are loosely grouped by priority and similarity to nearby categories. Sorting icons and categories alphabetically is generally avoided in favor of a more fluid approach. As such, navigating this project for the first time might take some getting used to.

Use the Search in the Assets tab (Alt+2) to find icons (If selecting one of the results doesnâ€™t bring it into view, you can Zoom to Selection through the menu).

### Grid

All icons are distributed on a grid composed of several rows:

- <span class="px-1 bg-purple-200 dark_bg-purple-700"><b>Drafting Row</b></span>: The top row is reserved for drafting new icons and should only contain the components used to create the source icons. These must be named with a leading double underscore<br>(ex. `__sub-component`).
- <span class="px-1 bg-pink-200 dark_bg-pink-900"><b>Component Row</b></span>: This row contains the source components and copies to be included in the category. These components must be named with a single leading underscroe<br>(ex. `_main-component`).
- <span class="px-1 bg-gray-300 dark_bg-gray-700"><b>Variants Row</b></span>: There can be any number of variants as long as they retain consistent naming conventions. The component set must be named the same as its source component but without leading underscores<br>(ex. `main-component`).

Explore the embedded Figma file to learn more about the grid.

### Naming Conventions

#### Categories

Categories are used to group similar icons and to help organize the thousands of components as the project continues to grow. Multi-word names are converted to camel-case when exporting data to JSON format.

#### Components

<alert>

Icons can use any name except for the ones specified in [this document](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/reserved-keywords).

</alert>

Components must follow strict formatting as mentioned in the [grid section](#grid).
- **Sub-components** must be named with a leading double underscore.
- **Source components** must be named with a leading single underscore.
- **Component sets** must be named the same as source components without the leading underscore.
- **Variant** names must be consistent with other variants.
- Refer to the [source file](/docs/figma/overview#source-file) on Figma for examples.

Icons with alternative designs should receive a number suffix to the name, like `house-1`. This allows for countless design alternatives.

### Search Terms

Content inside component descriptions is used to tag the icon to improve search - both in Figma (when searching Assets), as well as in other applications.

<img class="show-dark" src="/content/description-dark.png" style="margin: 0" alt="Community File Preview" />
<img class="show-light" src="/content/description-light.png" style="margin: 0" alt="Community File Preview" />

If one or more components are used to create a new icon, the terms from all the contributing components will be included in the description of the new component. To avoid this behavior, simply rename the component instance used in the new component with two leading underscores.
